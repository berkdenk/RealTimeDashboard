Real-Time Data Visualization Dashboard
This project is a web-based application designed to provide real-time data visualization. It simulates live data updates using random value generation, offering a practical platform for monitoring and analyzing dynamic data streams in real-time.
Key Features:

    Real-Time Updates:
    Simulates live data using Math.random() to generate dynamic values, mimicking real-world data streams without requiring external data sources.

    Data Visualization:
    Utilizes modern libraries like D3.js or Chart.js to render interactive line charts, bar graphs, and other engaging visual elements.

    Frontend Interface:
    Built using React, the frontend provides a clean and intuitive user interface for displaying and interacting with real-time data.

    Backend Logic:
    A Node.js backend serves as the engine for generating and serving simulated real-time data updates via WebSocket.

    Responsive Design:
    Ensures the dashboard is fully responsive, offering an optimized user experience across devices and screen sizes.

    Customizable Alerts:
    Includes notification systems for highlighting significant changes or predefined conditions in the simulated data.

Technologies Used:

    Frontend: React, Chart.js/D3.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
    Backend: Node.js, WebSocket
    Data Source: Simulated data generated using Math.random() for development and testing.

Purpose:

This project demonstrates the implementation of a real-time data visualization system. It is ideal for showcasing skills in frontend and backend integration, real-time communication, and data visualization techniques.
